"""This module contains rules that build a fuzz target with sanitizer coverage.
https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html
To instrument a target with sancov, we apply a bazel transition
https://bazel.build/rules/lib/transition
to change its configuration (i.e., add the necessary compilation flags). The configuration will
affect all its transitive dependencies as well.
